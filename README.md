# map_digitilisation

Here we take a map upload it and left clicks on map coordinates will add node points and paths between succesive points

A right click will stop a path being made between two consecutive points.the we do queries on finding sortest pach between two points on the map and it shows the path.

Uses normal recursive depth first search on the graph structure we made to find sortest path.
